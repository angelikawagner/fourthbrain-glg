## Overview

We built a web application where the user can submit a question and gets matches to a subject-matter expert. The application sends the query to a REST API that parses the text and uses two machine learning algorithms to detect topics and keywords. It then displays the topic hierarchies, named entities, and subject-matter experts to the user.

## Background

How can we organize thousands of requests quickly and automatically with little human intervention? This is the challenge [GLG](https://glginsights.com), the world's largest expert network, faces every day. GLG receives hundreds of requests per day from clients looking for subject-matter experts that can help answer questions on topics ranging from the airline industryâ€™s ability to cope with COVID-19 to the zebra mussel infestations in North America. The goal is to quickly identify the topics and keywords in free-form text to match clients with a specialist in the database.

## Project goals
- Detect hierarchical clusters of topics from client submitted requests
- Group requests into common topics to better understand and service demand
- Automatic meta-data tagging
- Identify underlying patterns in submitted requests over time
- Create web application to demo algorithm and match clients to topic specialist in database

## Approach
- [2.7 million news articles](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/) as proxies for client request
  - Focused on healthcare and technology related topics
- [Top2Vec](https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec) algorithm for hierarchical clustering, served with FastAPI, deployed on AWS EC2
- Named entity recognition with SpaCy and SciSpaCy's NER models
- Streamlit web app
  - where user can submit a request and receive topic distribution and named entities
  - shows distribution of topic hierarchies over time
  - dockerized and deployed on AWS EC2
